excerpt: "A dataset can store documents to be **searched, retrieved, filtered and aggregated** (similar to Collections in MongoDB, Tables in SQL, Indexes in ElasticSearch).\n\nA powerful and core feature of VecDB is that you can store both your metadata and vectors in the same document. \nWhen specifying the schema of a dataset and inserting your own vector use the suffix (ends with) **\"\\_vector\\_\"** for the field name, and specify the length of the vector in dataset_schema.\n\nFor example:\n\n    {\n        \"product_image_vector_\": 1024,\n        \"product_text_description_vector_\" : 128\n    }\n\nThese are the field types supported in our datasets: **[\"text\", \"numeric\", \"date\", \"dict\", \"chunks\", \"vector\", \"chunkvector\"]**.\n\nFor example:\n\n    {\n        \"product_text_description\" : \"text\",\n        \"price\" : \"numeric\",\n        \"created_date\" : \"date\",\n        \"product_texts_chunk_\": \"chunks\",\n        \"product_text_chunkvector_\" : 1024\n    }\n\nYou don't have to specify the schema of every single field when creating a dataset, as VecDB will automatically detect the appropriate data type for each field (vectors will be automatically identified by its **\"\\_vector\\_\"** suffix). Infact you also don't always have to use this endpoint to create a dataset as **/datasets/bulk_insert** will infer and create the dataset and schema as you insert new documents.\n\nNote: \n * A dataset name/id can only contain undercase letters, dash, underscore and numbers.\n * \"\\_id\" is reserved as the key and id of a document.\n * Once a schema is set for a dataset it cannot be altered. If it has to be altered, utlise the copy dataset endpoint.\n\nFor more information about vectors check out the 'Vectorizing' section, **/services/search/vector** or out blog at [https://relevance.ai/blog](https://relevance.ai/blog).\nFor more information about chunks and chunk vectors check out **/services/search/chunk**."
