Relevance AI is designed and built to help developers to experiment, build and share the best vectors to solve similarity and relevance based problems across the organisation.

- **Fully managed API**, so that you don't have to manage infastructure or devops.
- **Filter and traditional keyword search**, combine traditional methods with vector search to maximize search relevance.
- **Hybrid vector database**, flexible data structures that allows for storing of multiple vectors and metadata in 1 datset so that you don't have to manage multiple nearest neighbor indices or 3rd party metadata store for every dataset.
- **Flexible multi-vector search**, flexible search methods that allows you to easily add and weight multiple different vectors into your search query to query against different data structures such as chunk. To find the best vectors and search methods for each problem.
- **Operations beyond vector search**, clustering for topic modelling, vector averaging against a category to create category vectors.
- **Visualize and interpret vectors**, visualize the biases of your vectors in multi-dimensional space with our embeddings projector and vector comparator graphs.
- **Real-time vector index**, no index rebuilding or constant retraining. Vectors become searchable as soon as they are inserted.
- **Production-grade**, once you have finished experimenting, and decided on the vectors and vector methods for search, recommendations or more. Deploy into either our enterprise production grade environment for low latency vector search or your own faiss or elasticsearch with ease.
