Relevance AI's playground makes experimenting with vector search easy!

You can try out our playground here: [https://cloud.relevance.ai](https://cloud.relevance.ai)

In the playground, you will see the different applications vectors can provide and all the different ways that vectors can be used (intelligent feeds, image to text search, personalised recommendations). You can test the effectiveness of the results for yourself! If you are interested in building your own, we recommend our other articles.
