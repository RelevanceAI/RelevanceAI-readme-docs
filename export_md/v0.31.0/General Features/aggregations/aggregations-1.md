One of the most useful analysis tools is **grouping** and **aggregating** data based on their similarities and features. Using the Relevance AI platform, datasets can first be grouped and subsequently combined with one or more aggregation metrics which leads to a quick and easy data summarization.

This article briefly explains the main aggregation functions. We use a demo dataset containing 5885 different real-estate properties. The goal is to find out how properties differ in terms of average price and other characteristics across different locations in Sydney, Australia.
