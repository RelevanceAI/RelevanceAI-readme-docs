See [Cluster Aggregate](doc:cluster-aggregate)  for more details.

When using the SDK to run cluster aggregations, you're able to visualize your results in our Dashboard. You can read more about this [flow here](https://docs.relevance.ai/docs/quick-tour).

The SDK will provide you a link, as pictured below, to the dashboard:

The dashboard will visualise your aggregation results in a table. Look for a "Save Aggregation" button to the top right. Click this to save the aggregation query for use in your Clusters app!
