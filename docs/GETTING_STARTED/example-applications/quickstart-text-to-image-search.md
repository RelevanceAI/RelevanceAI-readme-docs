This section, we will show you how to create and experiment with a powerful text-to-image search engine using OpenAI's CLIP and Relevance AI. 


**Try it out in Colab:** [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/_assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/RelevanceAI/RelevanceAI-readme-docs/blob/v0.28.0/docs/GETTING_STARTED/example-applications/_notebooks/RelevanceAI_ReadMe_Quickstart_Text_to_Image_Search.ipynb)


### What I Need
* Project and API Key: Grab your Relevance AI project and API key by [signing up](https://cloud.relevance.ai/ )
* Python 3 (ideally a Jupyter Notebook/Colab environment)


### Installation Requirements

Prior to starting, let's install the main dependencies. This installation provides you with what you need to connect to Relevance AI's API, read/write data, make different searches, etc.


```bash Bash
!pip install -U -q RelevanceAI==0.31.0
```
```bash
```

This will give you access to Relevance AI's Python SDK.

### Setting Up Client

After installation, we need to also set up an API client. If you are missing an API key, you can easily sign up and get your API key from [https://cloud.relevance.ai/](https://cloud.relevance.ai/) in the settings area.



```python Python (SDK)
from relevanceai import Client 

"""
You can sign up/login and find your credentials here: https://cloud.relevance.ai/sdk/api
Once you have signed up, click on the value under `Authorization token` and paste it here
"""
client = Client()

```
```python
```


## Steps to create text to image search with CLIP

To be able to perform text-to-image search, we will show you how to: 

1. Get sample data
2. Vectorize the data
3. Insert into your dataset
4. Search your dataset

### 1. Data

Here, we use our sample e-commerce dataset and preview one of the documents. 



```python Python (SDK)

from relevanceai.datasets import get_ecommerce_dataset

# Get the e-commerce dataset
documents = get_ecommerce_dataset()
documents[0]

```
```python
```

An example document should have a structure that looks like this:


```json JSON
{
  "_id": "711158459",
  "_unit_id": 711158459,
  "product_description": "The PlayStation 4 system opens the door to an incredible journey through immersive new gaming worlds and a deeply connected gaming community.

  "product_image": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/d/l225/m/mzvzEUIknaQclZ801YCY1ew.jpg",
  "product_link": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Sony-PlayStation-4-PS4-Latest-Model-500-GB-Jet-Black-Console-/321459436277?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item4ad879baf5",
  "product_price": "$329.98 ",
  "product_title": "Sony PlayStation 4 (PS4) (Latest Model)- 500 GB Jet Black Console",
  "query": "playstation 4",
  "rank": 1,
  "relevance": 3.67,
  "relevance:variance": 0.47100000000000003,
  "source": "eBay",
  "url": "https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2050601.m570.l1313.TR11.TRC1.A0.H0.Xplant.TRS0&_nkw=playstation%204"
}

```
```json
```

As you can see each data entry contains both text (`product_title`, `product_description`) and image (`product_image`).


### 2. Encode

CLIP is a vectorizer from OpenAI that is trained to find similarities between text and image pairs. In the code below we set up and install CLIP. 

<figure>

<figcaption>Photo of OpenAI's CLIP architecture from OpenAI (https://openai.com/blog/clip/)</figcaption>
<figure>


CLIP installation


```bash Bash
!pip install -q ftfy regex tqdm
!pip install -q git+https://github.com/openai/CLIP.git
```
```bash
```



We instantiate the model and create functions to encode both image and text.



```python Python (SDK)
import torch
import clip
import requests
from PIL import Image

device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
model, preprocess = clip.load("ViT-B/32", device=device)

# First - let's encode the image based on CLIP
def encode_image(image):
    # Let us download the image and then preprocess it
    image = preprocess(Image.open(requests.get(image, stream=True).raw)).unsqueeze(0).to(device)
    # We then feed our processed image through the neural net to get a vector
    with torch.no_grad():
      image_features = model.encode_image(image)
    # Lastly we convert it to a list so that we can send it through the SDK
    return image_features.tolist()[0]

# Next - let's encode text based on CLIP
def encode_text(text):
    # let us get text and then tokenize it
    text = clip.tokenize([text]).to(device)
    # We then feed our processed text through the neural net to get a vector
    with torch.no_grad():
        text_features = model.encode_text(text)
    return text_features.tolist()[0]
```
```python
```


We then encode the data.


> ðŸš§ Skip encoding and insert, as we have already encoded the data into vectors for you!
> 
> Skip if you don't want to wait and re-encode the data as the e-commerce dataset already includes vectors.



```python Python (SDK)
def encode_image_document(d):
  d['clip_product_image_vector_'] = encode_image(d['product_image'])

# Let's import TQDM for a nice progress bar!
from tqdm.auto import tqdm
[encode_image_document(d) for d in tqdm(documents)]
```
```python
```


### 3. Insert

Lets insert documents into the dataset `quickstart_clip`.


```python Python (SDK)
client.insert_documents("quickstart_clip", docs=documents)
```
```python
```

Once we have inserted the data into the dataset, we can visit [RelevanceAI dashboard](https://cloud.relevance.ai/dataset/quickstart_clip/dashboard/monitor/vectors). The dashboard gives us a great overview of our dataset as shown below. 

<figure>
<img src="https://github.com/RelevanceAI/RelevanceAI-readme-docs/blob/v0.28.0/docs_template/GETTING_STARTED/example-applications/_assets/RelevanceAI_quickstart_clip_dashboard.png?raw=true" width="650" alt="RelevanceAI Dashboard" />
<figcaption>Relevance AI dashboard</figcaption>

### 4. Search

Lets first encode our text search query to vectors using CLIP.



```python Python (SDK)
query = "for my baby daughter"
query_vector = encode_text(query)
```
```python
```


Now, let us try out a query using a simple vector search against our dataset.


```python Python (SDK)
results = client.services.search.vector(
    # This is the dataset that you use for  search
    dataset_id="quickstart_clip",
    # Construct a multivector query here
    multivector_query=[
        {
            "vector": query_vector,
            "fields": ["clip_product_image_vector_"]
        }
    ],
    # The number of returned results
    page_size=5
)
```
```python
```

Here our query is just a simple multi-vector query, but our search comes with out of the box support for features such as multi-vector, filters, facets and traditional keyword matching to combine with your vector search. You can read more about how to construct a multivector query with those features [here](vector-search-prerequisites).

Next, we use `show_json` to visualize images and text easily and quickly!


```python Python (SDK)
from relevanceai import show_json

show_json(
    results['results'], 
    image_fields=["product_image"], 
    text_fields=["product_title"]
)
```
```python
```

## Final Code

```python Python (SDK)
from relevanceai import Client

client = Client()

# Now we get an e-commerce dataset
from relevanceai.datasets import get_ecommerce_dataset
documents = get_ecommerce_dataset()

# Encoding
import torch
import clip
import requests
from PIL import Image

device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
model, preprocess = clip.load("ViT-B/32", device=device)

# First - let's encode the image based on CLIP
def encode_image(image):
    # Let us download the image and then preprocess it
    image = preprocess(Image.open(requests.get(image, stream=True).raw)).unsqueeze(0).to(device)
    # We then feed our processed image through the neural net to get a vector
    with torch.no_grad():
      image_features = model.encode_image(image)
    # Lastly we convert it to a list so that we can send it through the SDK
    return image_features.tolist()[0]

# Next - let's encode text based on CLIP
def encode_text(text):
    # let us get text and then tokenize it
    text = clip.tokenize([text]).to(device)
    # We then feed our processed text through the neural net to get a vector
    with torch.no_grad():
        text_features = model.encode_text(text)
    return text_features.tolist()[0]

query = "for my baby daughter"
query_vector = encode_text(query)

results = client.services.search.vector(
    # This is the dataset that you have searched
    dataset_id="quickstart_clip",
    # Construct a multivector query here
    multivector_query=[
        {
            "vector": query_vector,
            "fields": ["clip_product_image_vector_"]
        }
    ],
    # The number of results that you want
    page_size=5
)

from relevanceai import show_json
show_json(
    results['results'], 
    image_fields=["product_image"], 
    text_fields=["product_title"]
)
```
```python
```



In this page, we saw a quick start to text-to-image search. Following this guide, we will explain how to conduct a search using multiple vectors!
