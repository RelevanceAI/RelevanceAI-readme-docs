## Combining filters
It is possible to combine multiple filters. For instance, the sample code below shows a filter that searches for
* a Lenovo flip cover
* produced after January 2020
* by either Lapguard or 4D brand.
A screenshot of the results can be seen on top.

```bash Bash
# remove `!` if running the line in a terminal
!pip install -U RelevanceAI[notebook]==1.2.0
```
```bash
```

```python Python (SDK)
from relevanceai import Client

"""

"""
client = Client()
```
```python
```

```python Python (SDK)
DATASET_ID = "ecommerce-sample-dataset"
df = client.Dataset(DATASET_ID)
```
```python
```

```python Python (SDK)
filter = [
    {
        "field": description,
        "filter_type" : contains,
        "condition": ==,
        "condition_value": Lenovo
    },
    {
        "field" : brand,
        "filter_type" : categories,
        "condition": ==,
        "condition_value": ['Lapguard', '4D']
    },
    {
        "field" : "insert_date_",
        "filter_type" : date,
        "condition": >=,
        "condition_value": 2020-01-01
    }
]
```
```python
```

```python Python (SDK)
### TODO: update to match the latest SDK
filtered_data = df.get_where(filter)
```
```python
```
