## `word_match`
This filter has similarities to both `exact_match` and `contains`. It returns a document only if it contains a **word** value matching the filter; meaning substrings are covered in this category but as long as they can be extracted with common word separators like the white-space (blank). For instance, the filter value "Home Gallery",  can lead to extraction of a document with "Buy Home Fashion Gallery Polyester ..." in the description field as both words are explicitly seen in the text. *Note that this filter is case-sensitive.*
