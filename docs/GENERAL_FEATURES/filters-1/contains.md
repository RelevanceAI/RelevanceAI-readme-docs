<figcaption>Filtering documents containing "Durian BID" in description using filter_type `contains`.</figcaption>
<figure>


## `contains`

This filter returns a document only if it contains a string value. Note that substrings are covered in this category. For instance, if a product name is composed of a name and a number (e.g. ABC-123), one might remember the name but not the number. This filter can easily return all products including the ABC string.
*Note that this filter is case-sensitive.*
