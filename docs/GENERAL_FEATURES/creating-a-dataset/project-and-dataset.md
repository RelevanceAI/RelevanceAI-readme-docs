To be able to conduct vector experiments using Relevance AI, you need to sign up at https://cloud.relevance.ai/. Alternatively, you can follow the [guide](doc:installation) on our installation page.

## Datasets

After uploading a dataset to your account in Relevance AI, you can preview your data in the dashboard https://cloud.relevance.ai under Dataset. Note that if you just started, your account will be empty!

## Interacting With Datasets

By storing data on our platform, you can directly invoke vectorization models, perform an optimized nearest-neighbor search, cluster data, etc.

Some basic actions to deal with datasets are:

- Create a dataset
- List the available datasets in a project/account
- Monitor a specific dataset
- Delete a dataset

You can either use the dashboard to take these actions or employ Relevance AI Python SDK. For the Python SDK, you need to install Relevance AI and initiate a client as shown in the two code snippets below:

```bash Bash
!pip install -U RelevanceAI[notebook]==0.33.2
```
```bash
```

```python Python (SDK)
from relevanceai import Client

"""
You can sign up/login and find your credentials here: https://cloud.relevance.ai/sdk/api
Once you have signed up, click on the value under `Authorization token` and paste it here
"""
client = Client()
```
```python
```

### Creating a dataset
To create a new empty dataset pass the name under which you wish to save the dataset to the `create` function as shown below. In this example, we have used `ecommerce-sample-dataset` as the name.

```python Python (SDK)
df = client.Dataset(ecommerce-sample-dataset)
df.insert_documents(documents)
```
```python
```

See [Inserting and updating documents](doc:inserting-data) for more details on how to insert/upload documents into a dataset.
> ðŸš§ Remember!
>
> * You cannot rename datasets or rename/edit existing field names. However, you can copy datasets and edit field names using the [`clone`](https://relevanceai.github.io/RelevanceAI/docs/html/relevanceai.api.endpoints.html?highlight=clone#relevanceai.api.endpoints.datasets.Datasets.clone) feature.
* Id field: Relevance AI platform identifies unique data entries within a dataset using a field called `_id` (i.e. every document in the dataset must include an `_id` field with a unique value per document).
* Vector fields: the name of vector fields must end in `_vector_`

### List your datasets

You can see a list of all datasets you have uploaded to your account in the dashboard.

Alternatively, you can use the list endpoint under Python SDK as shown below:

```python Python (SDK)
client.list_datasets()
```
```python
```

### Monitoring a specific dataset

RelevanceAI's dashboard at https://cloud.relevance.ai is the most straightforward place to monitor your data.

Alternatively, you can monitor the health of a dataset using the command below which returns the count of total missing and existing fields in the data points in the named dataset.

```python Python (SDK)
df.health
```
```python
```

### Deleting a dataset

Deleting an existing dataset can be done on the dashboard using the delete option availabal for each dataset. Or through the Python SDK:

```python Python (SDK)
client.delete_dataset(dataset_id="ecommerce-sample-dataset")
```
```python
```
