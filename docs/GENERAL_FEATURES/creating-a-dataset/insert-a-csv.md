A very common format for saving data is `CSV`. The `insert_csv` function enables us to directly upload our CSV files to Relevance AI.

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/RelevanceAI/RelevanceAI-readme-docs/blob/v1.0.7/docs/GENERAL_FEATURES/creating-a-dataset/_notebooks/creating-a-dataset.ipynb)


## Data:
* Format: the file passed to the `insert_csv` function must be a valid CSV file
* Fields: the CSV file can include as many columns as needed
* Vector fields: the name of vector fields must end in `_vector_`
* Id field: Relevance AI platform identifies unique data entries within a dataset using a field called `_id` (i.e. every document in the dataset must include an `_id` field with a unique value per document). There are some arguments to help you take care of this field when using `insert_csv`

### Handling document unique identifier (`_id`)
* If the dataset includes a unique identifier per document but the name of the field is not `_id`, simply pass the name under `col_for_id`. For instance, in the example below, the field `REF-No` contains the unique identifier that can be passed as `_id`.

### Using `insert_csv`

First, the Relevance AI SDK package must be installed.

```bash Bash
!pip install -U RelevanceAI[notebook]==1.0.7
```
```bash
```

```python Python (SDK)
from relevanceai import Client

"""
You can sign up/login and find your credentials here: https://cloud.relevance.ai/sdk/api
Once you have signed up, click on the value under `Authorization token` and paste it here
"""
client = Client()
```
```python
```


Uploading a CSV file is as simple as specifying the CSV path to your file.


```python Python (SDK)
df = client.Dataset('quickstart_insert_csv')

csv_fpath = "./sample_data/california_housing_test.csv"
df.insert_csv(filepath_or_buffer = csv_fpath)
```
```python
```
