Relevance AI's mission is to accelerate developers to solve similarity and relevance problems through data. As our first step towards helping teams, we started with the data type that all the top tech companies use - vectors, a high dimensional representation of data used to determine similarities between data. 

Some important similarity and relevance based problems that can be solved with vectors:
- Semantic & unstructured data search
- Recommendation systems
- Data deduplication & matching
- Topic modelling
- User clustering
- Zero shot classification
- K-nearest neighbors similarity-based regression
- Semantic operation
- and many more


## Experimentation-first vector platform
In the vector workflow to solve search and relevance problems, we decided to focus heavily on the foundation of all good solutions - the **experimentation stage**. Our **experimentation-first** approach helps users experiment, tune and prototype various vector weightings, configurations, data structures and vector search methods to improve their vectors. For a more in-depth exploration and comparison take a look at our article on [experimentation-first vector database](doc:why-experimentation-first).

- **Fully managed API**, so that you don't have to manage infrastructure or DevOps.
- **Filter and traditional keyword search**, combine traditional methods with vector search to maximize search relevance.
- **Hybrid vector database**, flexible data structures that allows for storing of multiple vectors and metadata in 1 dataset so that you don't have to manage multiple nearest neighbor indices or 3rd party metadata store for every dataset.
- **Flexible multi-vector search**, flexible search methods that allows you to easily add and weight multiple different vectors into your search query to query against different data structures such as chunk. To find the best vectors and search methods for each problem.
- **Operations beyond vector search**, clustering for topic modelling, vector averaging against a category to create category vectors.
- **Visualize and interpret vectors**, visualize the biases of your vectors in multi-dimensional space with our embeddings projector and vector comparator graphs.
- **Real-time vector index**, no index rebuilding or constant retraining. Vectors become searchable as soon as they are inserted.
- **Production-grade**, once you have finished experimenting, and decided on the vectors and vector methods for search, recommendations or more. Deploy into either our enterprise production-grade environment for low latency vector search or your own FAISS or Elasticsearch with ease.
